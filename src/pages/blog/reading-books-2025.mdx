## The Big Question

My friend just "read" 10 books on his commute this week.

How? 15-minute AI-generated summaries at 2x speed.

It got me thinking, and let's be honest: in <CurrentYear />, why would *anyone* bother reading a full book?

We're drowning in content. We have AI that can summarize *War and Peace* into five bullet points. We have YouTube videos, podcasts, and masterclasses that promise to teach us everything faster.

So, is sitting down with a 300-page book just an inefficient, outdated ritual?

### The Trap We All Fell Into

Here’s the problem: We started treating reading like a competition. It became another metric for our "productivity." and sometimes even false promises.

> Reading for some people, became about **consumption** and **completion**, not **understanding** or **transformation**.

And that's precisely why we're burned out on it. We're confusing "finishing" a book with "learning" from it.

## The Great Divide: Information vs. Transformation

I've realized there are really only two kinds of reading. And we're using the wrong strategy for both.

### 1. Books for INFORMATION (The "What")

These are the "how-to" books. The 800-page technical manuals. The business books that repeat one single idea for 250 pages.

* *101 Digital Marketing Hacks*
* *The Complete Guide to React 19*
* *That new business book about "synergy"*

In my honest opinion, for *these* books, the new tools are probably better.

That 800-page tech book? It's already outdated. The official docs and a few targeted YouTube tutorials are 100x more efficient. That business book? A service like [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/) or an AI summary *will* give you the one core idea.

**For these IT, Digital Marketing books, maybe reading a summary is the best approach.**

### 2. Books for TRANSFORMATION (The "Why")

Then, there are the other books. The ones that don't just give you facts; they rewire your brain.

They're the ones that challenge your worldview. They make you argue with the author in your head. They sit with you for weeks.

* **Man's Search for Meaning** - Viktor Frankl
* **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck** - Mark Manson (One of my favorites when I was younger)
* **Meditations** - Marcus Aurelius
* **Sapiens** - Yuval Noah Harari
* **The Courage to Be Disliked** - Ichiro Kishimi

You cannot get the "key insights" from these. The "insight" *is* the entire experience of reading it.

You can't summarize a perspective shift. You can't get empathy from a bullet list. You have to sit with the ideas. Let them marinate.

**These are the books that are still worth your time. All of it.**

## So, What's the Real Value in <CurrentYear />?

If summaries are good for information, why bother with the transformational books?

1.  **It Rebuilds Your Attention Span:** Let's be real. Our brains are being rewired by 1-minute videos full of jump-cuts and non-stop notifications. Our **attention span** is "cooked". Reading is the antidote. Sitting with a single, non-blinking task for an hour isn't just a superpower; it's active mental repair. It's mental crossfit for your focus.

2.  **It Teaches You *How* to Think:** A summary gives you the final answer. A good book shows you the *process* the messy, winding path of an argument. You learn how to build your own arguments, not just repeat someone else's.
3.  **It Develops Empathy:** Reading fiction or a good biography is the closest thing we have to telepathy. It forces you to live inside someone else's head. You can't get that from a "Top 10 Takeaways" video.

## My "Reading" Manifesto for <CurrentYear />

So, is reading books worth it?

**Yes. But I'm ruthless about *what* I read.**

### What's Worth Your Full Attention:

* **Wisdom & Spiritual Texts:** If you wake up and like to read the Bible, or any text that centers you, **DO IT**. That process will make you better long before any "productivity hack" book will.

* **Philosophy & Perspectives:** Books that change how you see the world. Read them slowly.
* **Classic Literature:** Stories that explore *why* humans are the way they are.
* **Fantasy books** that transport you to another world. Just like movies, video games, or TV shows, they give your brain a break from reality while still engaging your imagination.
* **Dense Biographies:** See how other people navigated their own chaos.
* **Challenging Essays:** Anything that makes you feel a little uncomfortable.
* **Books that Make You Argue:** If a book makes you want to argue with the author, it's worth it. Engage with it.

### What's Not (Just get the summary):
* **Most "Productivity" Books:** You know this stuff. Wake up early, make a list.
* **Pop-Science/Business Books:** The ones that could have been a 20-page article.
* **Technical Manuals:** Use [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) for classics, but use official docs for code.

## Final Thought

We're drowning in information but starving for wisdom.

Maybe the solution isn't to read *more*, faster. Maybe it's to read *less*, but better.

> The goal isn't to consume more content. It's to find the few ideas that are worth sitting with. A book also can be a sanctuary in a noisy world.

That 600-page tech manual? Maybe, as a programmer for example, do you really need to read [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) to know how to write better code?

But that 150-page philosophy book that makes my head hurt? **Yes. That's the one. I'm reading that.**

That's why books are still worth it.
