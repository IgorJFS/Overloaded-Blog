## The Uncomfortable Question

Someone asked me last week if I still read books. Like, actual full books. Cover to cover.

I paused. Because honestly? Sometimes I don't know anymore.

We live in a world where you can get the "key insights" from any book in 15 minutes. Where AI can summarize entire libraries. Where YouTube videos promise to teach you everything faster, better, more efficiently.

So why bother with books at all?

### The farse of Productivity

Here's the trap we all fell into: we started treating books like checklists.

"I read 52 books this year!" great. Do you remember any of them?

We skim. We speed-read. We listen at 2x speed while doing three other things. We collect books like trophies, makes us look smart on a videocall.

> Reading became about consumption, not transformation or understanding.

And that's exactly why we're asking if books are even worth it anymore.

## Not All Books Are Created Equal

Here's what I've learned: There are two types of books.

### Books That Change How You See the World

These are the ones worth reading. Slowly. Deliberately. Multiple times if needed.

Books like:
- **The subtle art of not giving a f*ck** - Mark Manson
- **Man's Search for Meaning** - Viktor Frankl
- **The Courage to Be Disliked** - Ichiro Kishimi
- **Meditations** - Marcus Aurelius
- **The Myth of Sisyphus** - Albert Camus

These aren't information dumps. They're perspective shifts. You can't summarize a perspective shift into 5 bullet points.

You need to sit with these ideas. Let them marinate. Argue with them in your head at 2 AM.

**These books? Read them. Fully. Because even if it's not best book you ever read, you might find something valuable in it.**

### Technical Books That Promise "Everything You Need to Know"

Then there are those 1000-page technical monsters promising to teach you Digital Marketing, or programming, or how to build a spaceship, or whatever.

That 1000-page programming book? Maybe the you will gain full understanding, maybe would be better ask GPT to summarize, or maybe you just should read some specific chapters.

**For these? Summaries, documentation, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos, cheap [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) Courses might suffice.**

## The Real Answer

So is reading books worth it in 2025?

**Yes. But don't go spending your precious money on another "proof of knowledge"**

### What's Worth Your Time:

1. **Philosophy and perspectives** - Read these fully. They change you.
2. **Literature that matters** - Stories that explore the human condition
3. **Biographies of interesting people** - How others navigated their chaos
4. **Essays that challenge you** - Short, dense, thought-provoking

### What's Not:

1. **"Complete guides" to anything** - Use documentation instead
2. **Business books that repeat one idea for 300 pages** - Read the summary
3. **Self-help that's just repackaged common sense** - You already know this stuff
4. **Technical references** - These are for looking up, not reading through

## The Meta Point

We're drowning in content. Books, podcasts, videos, threads, newsletters-everyone screaming that you need to learn more, consume more, optimize more.

Maybe the real question isn't "should I read books?"

Maybe it's: **"What am I actually trying to understand, and what's the best way to do that?"**

Sometimes that's a full book. Sometimes it's a 10-page essay. Sometimes it's just sitting quietly and thinking about what you already know.

### Permission to Be Selective

You don't have to read everything. You don't have to finish books you started. You don't have to feel guilty about choosing a summary over a thousand pages of technical jargon.

> The goal isn't to read more. It's to understand better.

## Final Thoughts

I still read books. But I'm pickier now. Besides, books cost money, time, and attention-three things we can't afford to waste that much specially when we are students.


That 800-page framework documentation disguised as a book? Hard pass. I'll stick to the docs and targeted tutorials.

**Reading is worth it in 2025. Just not all reading. And definitely not all books.**

Choose the ones that matter. Skip the rest without guilt.
